# About Project
In this project, we aim to build a mobile arrhythmia classifier system. The model was developed in Python using Tensorflow as the deep learning framework.
The model was compressed using quantization in order to make the model smaller and faster in computation. Finally, the model was deployed to the android app as a proof-of-concept.
